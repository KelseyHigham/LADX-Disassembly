; The French text uses two diacritic tiles:
; - 1: ´ (Acute accent on uppercase letter)
; - 2: ` (Grave accent on uppercase letter)
;
; However diacritics support for the French version is actually disabled:
; this table, as well as the associated diacritics, is unused.
;
; This is probably because, even if the French text has accentuated
; capitals like "É" in some places, supporting diacritics on all
; capital letters would require three diacritics (´, ` and ^), where
; the tilemap only reserve space for two. In the retail version, all
; french capital letters are left unaccentuated.
